# EvaluatePeriodicDigraphIBF
The source code implements:
- the runtime evaluatation of the periodic IBF of digraph tasks
- a set of the (exact, approximate and linear upper bound) response time analyses for the digraph task systems

And the code has been tested to work well in Visual Studio 2012 with Microsoft Windows 7.

## Optional Requirements ##

GoogleTest--Used to do the unit test.<\br>
Visual Leak Detection--Used to check the memory leaks.

## Evaluating Procedure ##

The main.cpp file includes all the experiments for our paper "Schedulability Analysis of Digraph Tasks with Interference Bound Func-
tions", which is submitted to Real-Time Systems(2016). http://www.faculty.ece.vt.edu/zeng/Digraph IBF.pdf".

Actually, the code also includes the stateflow analysis framework.
